This is my attempt at a ticketing system

Add delete button to each post
  Add file add button to each post?

enable enter button to trigger click events

placeholder in footer space if no channel selected

reduce width of channel create input

placeholder for channel header space when channel selected so everything isn't so squished

notification for when a post is created in a channel

test 20 message loads per time (possibly with button)


COMPLETED:
change background color of channel list to dark and channel names to white text

move post create button into footer space?

-add active user count for load channel (/get)

Change "Welcome to Flack" to selected channel name

username create and channel create inputs need to clear after button click

username change form needs to move below slack header in right section if form appears

100 message display cap (tested with 5 message cap)
