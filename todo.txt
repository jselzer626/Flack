Todo's
This is my attempt at a ticketing system

User details in right column displays total posts and total active conversations

Starred posts collect in user details section


COMPLETED:

test 20 message loads per time (possibly with button) this needs to be integrated with the nomral channel load function

change background color of channel list to dark and channel names to white text

move post create button into footer space?

-add active user count for load channel (/get)

Change "Welcome to Flack" to selected channel name

username create and channel create inputs need to clear after button click

username change form needs to move below slack header in right section if form appears

100 message display cap (tested with 5 message cap)

Add delete button to each post

  need to find a way to index each post

add star post

enable enter button to trigger click events

only first post allows you to either check starred post or trashcan

reduce width of channel create input

when post is deleted and no more posts in channel space then display a placeholder message

create arrows to indicate first create username, then create channel

high username create box when arrow is pointing then same for channel create

update active users when post is deleted
